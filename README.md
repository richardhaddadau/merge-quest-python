# Merge Quest
Welcome to Merge Quest!

Merge Quest is a terminal-based puzzle game written in Python as a small side-project. It is similar to 2048 where 
you shift blocks to merge them and upgrade, but instead of multiplying the score by 2, you merge blocks to reach higher levels.

## Introduction

Merge Quest is a simple and fun game played directly in your terminal. Use the W, A, S, D keys to shift blocks. When two blocks of the same level collide, they merge into a higher-level block. The game introduces new blocks after each move. Plan your moves carefully to reach higher levels!

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:richardhaddadau/merge-quest-python.git
    cd merge-quest-python
    ```

2.  **Run the game**:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## How to Play

1. **Start the game**:
   Run the game script using Python.

2. **Controls**:
    - **W**: Move blocks up
    - **A**: Move blocks left
    - **S**: Move blocks down
    - **D**: Move blocks right
    - **Q**: Quit the game

3. **Objective**:
   Shift the blocks in the grid to merge blocks of the same level. When two blocks of the same level collide, they merge into a higher-level block. The game adds a new block at the edge after each move. Plan your moves to create higher-level blocks and achieve the highest score possible.
